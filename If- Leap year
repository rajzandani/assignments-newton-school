Given a year, find if it is a leap year. Leap year is the year that is multiple of 4. But, multiples of 100 which are not multiples of 400 are not leap years.

import java.util.Scanner;
class Main {
  public static void main (String[] args)
   {
       //Capture the user's input
       Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
       //Storing the captured value in a variable
       int n = scanner.nextInt();
       LeapYear(n);

    
}
static void LeapYear(int year){
    if(year%400==0||year%4==0&&year%100!=0){
        System.out.println("YES");
    }
    else 
        System.out.println("NO");
    
    }
}
